#A tale of tales


You are a young and bright developer with a sharp mind for mathematics and a little too much passion for roulette. This night in particular, after winning for 2 hours straight at the local casino, you feel like you just cracked the roulette's "code". However, you get distracted for a moment and all your chips are gone a moment later. Determined to get it all back in one hand, you borrow money from Bambalore, a shady Mob guy you know. You lose that money.

Running for your life, a month later you get hired at a software shop, in a small town in Tirol, Austria. The shop uses Meteor and on the interview you sweared it's nothing you can't pick up in a week. Your boss used Cobol when she was young so every now and then she expects to explain to her how you do the things you do.

Things are far from cool: being the new kid in town gets you a desk on the hallway, under a red hidrant, so everybody coming in or going out can see your display. It's drafty and the ancient code editor you're forced to use has a 50% chance to crash every ten minutes or so, losing all your code, forcing you to rewrite it.

Ah,  immigrant life! By the end of the first day, your boss drops by and lets you know you have to deliver a chat app pronto. "I expect to see it by the end of the week, 'mkay?" she says, retreating into her big-windowed office from where you can see the misty Alps.

Session one of your work on the chat app goes by and sure enough, you made good progress: you decided the app is gonna be called **latChat**, you installed Meteor and poked around a basic app. At one point in the morning the boss showed up and asked you to change the background of the interface, make an incrementer start from 2 and then to jump a 2 step on every click of a button. You did good and your relief is obvious: on your way home you walk lightly, the air is sweet and you feel like you're gonna master this thing, after all.
