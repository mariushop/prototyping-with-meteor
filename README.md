# Prototyping with Meteor

Fast prototyping with JavaScript - nice skills to have when you hear "the client needs to see it by the end of the week".

## We'll actually prototype a product 
 - a chat app where you can upload images, files, documents and share messages with your team.

## We'll try a particular approach
 - hands on, mind on, voice on
 - we'll follow a story line ([this one](storyline.md))
 - we'll throw away our code after each session and rewrite it on the next

## Logistics
  - 4 seats available 
  - 2 hour sessions
  - we'll try different locations, at least one session out of office
  - start date: 1st of February 2016
