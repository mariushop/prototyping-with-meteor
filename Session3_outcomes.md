#Session 3 Outcomes

Today, everybody had to work on its own app for about half an hour, on the following brief:
"Your boss wants a demo. Work on an chat app beginning from scratch."

We had an open-session demo where we got the chance to see every app. Results were impressive: everybody got user signup/login/logout, messages saving and displaying.
In the process, Georgiana discovered that Meteor complains if you manually define a `users` collection, George installed a package that allowed displaying timestamps in a cool way and Zoltan incorporated `bootstrap`.

We debriefed:
   - how did you begin working?
   - what were you trying to achieve?
   - did you stumble on anything unexpected?
   - how did you feel?
   - if you had more time, what would you liked to address next?

Afterwards, we set on removing the `autopublish` package from the app and replicating the functionalities we lost by doing that. 
To achieve **database everywhere**, ant **latency compensation** we made use of the Publish/Subscribe pattern. 

At the end of the session, we worked a way to have multiple channels on the app and let the user switch between them.

I'm very satisfied with the learning rate and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Session 4.
